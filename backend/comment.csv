Let's not forget that Apple Pay in 2014 required a brand new iPhone in order to use it.  A significant portion of Apple's user base wasn't able to use it even if they wanted to.  As each successive iPhone incorporated the technology and older iPhones were replaced the number of people who could use the technology increased.,1
Here in NZ 50% of retailers don’t even have contactless credit card machines like pay-wave which support Apple Pay. They don’t like the high fees that come with these.,0
"I will forever acknowledge this channel with the help of your lessons and ideas explanations, Now It's quite helpful while you'll just sit at your comfort and monitor your account Growth.",2
"Whenever I go to a place that doesn’t take Apple Pay (doesn’t happen too often), it’s such a drag. Between ‘contactless Covid’ habits and my getting the Apple Card, I’ve gotten so used to Apple Pay that I get seriously annoyed when a store doesn’t take it. It feels like a shock, it’s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine! I’ve officially been brainwashed by Apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket.",0
"Apple Pay is so convenient, secure, and easy to use. I used it while at the Korean and Japanese airports, no need for physical credit cards.",2
"We’ve been hounding my bank to adopt Apple pay. I understand why they don’t want to do it with the extra fees, but its just so easy and quick at the checkout.",1
We only got Apple Pay in South Africa in 2020/2021 and it’s widely accepted.,2
"For now, I need both Apple Pay and the physical credit card.",1
"In the United States, we have an abundance of retailers that accept Apple Pay, but it's still good to carry the physical card with you, being there are still a large quantity of places that do NOT accept Apple Pay.",2
"In Cambodia, we have a universal QR code system, we scan and send money back and forth, all banks take no profit from merchant, they receive 100% of the payment. A lot of stores and supermarkets start abandon POS machine all together.",1
"Wow, you really went to town on the PSU test rack. That's a serious bit of kit. Very flexible, good choices. Wouldn't surprise me if Choma start offering this bespoke rack to the PSU makers. They all watch your videos, so they'll want to make sure it passes on this exact same rack. You can really push the industry here. Well done. Open source the test interface hardware and software.",2
The lab is the most exciting thing in IT I've seen for a while. This is reallly going to shake up how the qualiity of even basic components are manufactured.,2
"Linus, I'm an engineer and love the LMG content across all the channels.  Very much looking forward to more lab content and hope your engineering team will get more on camera time and hosting roles.",2
"There used to be a time where Linus was the smartest guy in the room, this video clearly shows that the team he has built are experts in their respective fields and make Linus look like a child. Kudos to Linus and LMG, you've grown beyond what I imagined. All the best!",2
Holy crap. I was looking at Chroma systems back when I was designing power supplies. Looks like you guys went all out! Re the multimeter: Most oscilloscopes are terrible for making accurate voltage measurements (8-10 bit ADCs). They are just for looking at the waveforms.,0
"I love the direction this channel is going. Most tech channels, even the best trusted ones are going to review products based on their own experience or at most some things they can measure with their pc, but you're really going to mathematically demonstrate if a product is a quality one and why it is, love it",2
"I am more excited for the LTT Lab than I have been for a lot of content for a while now. As everyone seems to be saying, it's exciting to see how enthusiastic this new crew is to get things running.",2
I adore the working relationship Linus has with his team. 99% of employees walk on eggshells around their boss and I wish it could be more like this.,2
"LMGs growth is honestly something to truly aspire for, this IS the content we want to watch. 

More technical, in depth, engineering oriented and science-based content will make us consumers much much more educated on these topics thus when picking a product not only will we pick the best choice but we'll know exactly why we picked it (which helps greatly with buyers remorse).",2
I love all the people LTT has added for labs. Clearly they're knowledgeable and passionate about tech! Labs is gonna be killer. Love it!,2
Linus!!! Just turn the key lights  180 and bounce them off the walls. You’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting. It’s such a simple fix. I’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face 😅,2
"Dan continues to be my new favorite, he has such an air of confidence about him and a comforting presence. Like Dan shows up and you just know things are going to be fine.",2
Dan managing to set up his soldering station on the one box they needed was incredibly amusing to me,2
Dan the man. Saving the day. Riley needs to give him his own theme like Brian the Electrician.,2
"Dan continues to be a favourite for me. He's like the incredibly patient, but long-suffering Dad, who just gets on with things",2
"Dan is a treasure. Your channel has long lacked a Mr. fixit type and while I am sad it's not me, Dan appears quite capable and funny.",2
"Blows my mind how quickly Dan became the ""rock"" upon which all things Linus stands...Love it",2
"Hey Linus, a good trick for streaming lights: bounce them off the wall.  Much easier on the eyes, and a nice softer look.
Also, for indoors, I'd recommend a hyper-cardioid mic (looks like a short shotgun) like the Audio-Technica AT4053B.",2

"Guys, a quick note that you do NOT need all the high-end tech in order to do well at college. If you can (and you should), save as much money as you can while at college, pay your tuition in full and student loans as soon as possible instead of spending on liabilities like gadgets. Get the bare minimum you need and only spend money on products you know you are going to be using for 4-6 years (such as laptop). Don't overspend on phone, headphones, lamps, tablets, etc.",1
"this is hilarious. i was in a focus group over 4 years ago for Best Buy where they were asking college students how to advertise for Back to School. One of the kids next to me said ""Maybe you should have someone like MKBHD talk about your products"". Well... here we are",1
"Everyone has been saying it but I’ll throw my hat in as well. To any prospective college students, you DO NOT need to spend money on flagship products. I am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base iPad from late 2020. Both products have worked flawlessly and I have no intention of replacing them. The recommendations listed are ones I would never be able to afford even with my job I’m working as well. Do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is. I promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it.",2
"Shoutout to my OnePlus phone and Huawei laptop for getting me through university feeling premium for MUCH less. Bonus ups for Ikea's articulating lamps ($20 and I can see all my homework incredibly well without eye strain), the old door I refinished to use as a desktop, and wired earbuds under hardware store earmuffs as my ""noise-cancelling headphones."" And the same 2 sets of Hanes underwear from target for also lasting the whole ride.",2
"BEST BUY: We want to sponsor a back to school type video. But you can only push the high end stuff.
Marques: say less",1
"Most of the items you recommend are pretty pricey for a student. I'm not a student myself anymore but if I were one, more budget alternatives would make this video a lot better!",1
"You don't necessarily need the high-end and latest tech for University.  I used a 2009 macbook pro throughout my years at uni , had an iphone 6 and it worked out just fine. What's important is to remain focused on getting that degree and graduating.",2
Personally I feel like this is really out of touch. Most students won't be able to afford these. In case anyone needs it: I believe Dave2D's back to school video are honestly the best ones I've seen on the topic. Consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision.,2
"Hey everyone. Good take on the video and love the recommendations. If you plan on making another video such as this, maybe you can also include some more budget options and best value options. 

What I can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what courses/programme you took for your education.
Engineering students require computer specs that can run BIM software. I'm not sure about the other programmes but from what I can see that most students at my place has 8GB of RAM for their laptops.

Also, here is my setup during my university years. Hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their college/university years. All the best.

Laptop - ASUS X455L (Upgraded to SSD with additional RAM)
Phone - Vivo Y69/Redmi 10/Samsung A22 4G
Mouse - Logitech G102
Keyboard - Tecware TKL ver",2
"I have used Galaxy Tab S7 during my Ph.D. It's been a lifesaver for me. First of all, it is really good for reading journals, note taking and scribbling on the pdf's, secondly, it doesn't strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance, thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with Tab s7 and lastly if you are from a STEM background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams, you can draw those easily with the stylus on Tab s7. I choose tab s7 over Apple Ipad Air for its ease of use, user interface, and cost (you get stylus for free with Tab S7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount).",2

"This series is exactly what career day should've been, such interesting and knowledgeable people!",2
"Regarding Cans vs. Bottles: At least in Germany the bottle is more environmentally friendly, since they get used again and again. You bring the empty bottles to the local grocery shop, they then get sent to a cleaning plant, where they pressurewash the bottles inside and out with steaming hot water. Afterwards they get reused for beer. The size and shape of most bottles is according to a standard, so different brewers use the same bottles.

It's far less energy intense than smelting and remanufacturing cans.",1

"One important aspect I'm surprised was left out is that many of these companies (like Amazon) literally power the internet. Almost 30% of the websites on the internet are stored on Amazon servers, giving them even more access to data trends and physical control over the internet.",2
Shout to you John Oliver for giving me a brief trip down memory lane.  I've been in the telecommunications industry for almost 25 years - and my first job was at....MCI.  Great company that got swallowed up in a horrible merger with WorldCom.  Bing it and see how that disaster played out.,1
"Back in 2018 when John Oliver did the episode on Corporate Consolidation it inspired me so much that I applied for a Masters of Research program, got into a program, and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies. It was shocking to see how bad it really is; oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant. My research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue. The answer was that it was truly both. I thoroughly enjoyed my pre-doctoral masters thesis and am considering a PhD in the future. It's so lovely to see John talk about this, specifically on the tech sector!

Edit: Wow! Thanks everyone for the great comments! I haven't published it yet, otherwise I would share it with all you lovely people ❤ I am now looking for a policy or qualitative research/analyst job so if anyone is hiring, let me know 😅",0

"I would love to see these bills live. I live in a country where we had one company try and rule the internet, charging outrageous prices for it. They had specifically bought the copper network to do it. The government of NZ denied that as a defense as they were monopolising it, and forced them to open up. Suddenly it turned out it DIDN'T cost $300 to connect to unlimited internet, you could get that for $80!",1
"Hey, something that might interest you. A couple of days ago my Amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time they're telling me it's for excessive returns which I think is an error but that's beside the point. When they closed my Amazon account all my Amazon devices that I own for years primarily all my Echo devices stopped working. I lost access to the Amazon Photos and Prime Video which I pay for. So apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by Amazon on your perceived shopping habits! I assume the same applies to all other Amazon devices and services like fire OS tablets, Ring cameras, and probably AWS as well. Just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely don't tell you this when you buy your hardware and services.",0
"Points that were missed: 

- Apple arguably has a specific Monopoly in the US with smartphones because of iMessage not being open with other multi-platform messaging apps. This weirdly only applies in the States. The rest of the world favours things like WhatsApp and Facebook messenger ( both owned by meta, Which is its own issue). That's probably the main defence Apple will bring up. 

- they've been in trouble before but don't forget about Microsoft, Windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove. 

- this kind of got glossed over but although Google play takes the same cut for purchases as Apple, you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like, so they avoid the heat there. Google play is still the most preferred store on Android phones, so Google likely takes advantage of that fact in promoting its own software.",1

as somebody with a comp sci degree and a decent amount of irl experience i will say edge computing is problematic at its core because client side workload like this is a huge security breach.  this is why even online video games avoid client side scripting.  it is a huge vector for exploit.  it is always interesting to watch a video like this because you are blown away when you listen regarding these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot determine the quality yourself,0

"In my experience, burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesn't produce improved rewards, it produces more work. The response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus, instead good work is ""rewarded"" with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time.

"As someone who used to work 80 hours a week, quitting my job to become a freelancer was the best thing I have ever done. Sure I still work a lot of hours and often close to 70-80 hrs a week, I feel like I am doing this for myself and not some corporation.",2
"I have a high paying tech job that I’m about to leave. I feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it, even though I worked hard to get to where I am. I was promoted very fast after 5 years. I know it’s something many people would love to have and honestly I’m happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot. Ultimately I became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life. I have lived humbly, saved every thing I could, paid off debts as quickly as possible, and have enough to live for 8 months to a year. I’m hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling.

For anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining, I hope you achieve your dream and get one. You can do it, keep at it! Taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing. I am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me (don’t let that scare you, I just have my own personal stuff too 😄).",2
"I’m a Software developer. I understand the struggle but us tech workers should count our lucky stars. We are very privileged to be where we are. Most jobs outside of tech have less perks, much lower pay, and more stress. I am grateful everyday to be in this field. Once I accumulate enough wealth to purchase my freedom, I’ll see myself out.. maybe. In the meantime, I will run the race as long as I have to.",2
"The thing is, if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule, you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility. You must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time, and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially. Leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows they're taking time off. This also empowers your teams, letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoulders.",2
"""Compare that to ... physicians, only 42% said they were burned out"" - Yes, indeed, a perfectly acceptable percentage.",2
"I worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out. The problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused. You can barely keep up. Though I got promoted regularly, my higher ups told me the truth before they left, they said that I was severely underpaid based on my skills (essentially I branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as I am both technically knowledgeable, people oriented and strategic). I maxed out at $50K. So I decided to jump ship with little planned. Now I run a financial agency with my husband and we make $250K a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle.",0

"That motion alarm for protecting your laptop makes me laugh.  If you are taking a break away from your workplace do you really think that the alarm feature would deter a thief from simply knocking the device to the floor, pick up the laptop and (perhaps) step on the alarm and crush it in a moment of disdain.  By the time you get back with your latte after your phone notifies you of your impending bad luck your laptop will be off on an extended trip.",0

"I spent hours researching dash cams a  year or so ago and it’s almost maddening how awful, sparse and misrepresented information on dash cams is. I was totally surprised how under developed they are. This is a video that is really necessary.",0
Vids like these are definitely a service for looking out for everyone to avoid buying crap and hype in dashcams. Well done in the research! Thanks LTT!,2
A favourite trick is to upscale a low resolution image before applying the compression - that way they get to claim a higher resolution on the box.  I've analysed a few of these now.,1
"I did not expect to love this video as much as I did... it epitomizes the very best of YouTube in my opinion - a well-made video with a well-constructed narrative, hosted flawlessly and provides a genuinely good service to everyone, even if they are not in the market for these products. Love your work LTT Team!",2
Thank you Linus for spending the big bucks and testing all these cameras for our benefit. I will be keeping your recommendations in mind when I purchase my camera.,2
"THIS is the kind of content that we need. Calling out trash markets and helping people find honest answers, doing the side-by-side comparisons they can't do. Thanks for this! Glad to know the Rove R2-4K I got as a gift is not far from really the peak in the market and is ""good enough"" if not overpriced a bit.",2
"Yup, it's amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country. In germany we have an entirely different line of knock-off chinese brands. Which ultimately look alike same goes for the Australian / american market. I am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within South Korea, Japan if anybody could give a hint to that! I mean surely they must have great dashcams right? Japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts, and well South Korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind.

I bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine. Problem I have with it is quality related the G-Sensor broke not long after I bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate. This creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings. And in that mode you can't disable the screen from flashing so at night drives you'll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope. It's your f#+*^# dashcam You can improve further the video quality for e.g. when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ND-Filter you just have to find your own way to mount them. Usually there is full filter clamping solutions. Because you'll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow.

I didn't do this yet as I did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so

"In all fairness, the VIOFO actually looks pretty great. Actually worth considering over the Thinkware F70 if the budget isn't too tight.",2
"When I went looking for a dashcam my main criteria was that it has a super cap instead of a battery, cause I really don't think the batteries would handle the -20 to -30c temps in winter and the exact opposite in the summer along with however much the sun heats up the interior. (I know you can take them off but I kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system)

For actual performance it's much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading, unless you really know your camera sensor specs.",0
"I had my suspicions about this for a long time, thank you for finally calling this issue out.  It sounds like there's a hole in the market for a truly high quality dashcam that's not Chinese crap.  Hopefully some tech company sees this and swoops in.  I'm tired of all these countless trash brands on Amazon with unpronounceable names.",0

Honestly can’t wait for the camera testing you do on the pros. As a iPhone 8 user anything will be an improvement though lol.,2
"I’ve been holding out cause i just felt it wasn’t worth upgrading but with everything coming to the 14 pro and the diminishing battery on my current iPhone X, it might be time to retire my phone after 5 years.",1
"Definitely upgrading from my 12 Pro Max to the 14 Pro Max, I'll get at least half the cost of the new phone back with trade in. Major upgrade in battery, camera, and the screen.",2
In my opinion the 13 mini is the best phone ever made. Seems I’m in a minority but it’s brilliant.,2
"Eh, I’m sticking with my 13 Pro Max until probably the 15 or 16. The cameras on the 14 Pros are literally the biggest worthwhile change this year imo.",2
I'm going to wait for the scheduled iPhone 15 Pro which will be scheduled to release in October 2023 if everything goes to plan. It is expected to have a USB C port and faster charging like the iPhone 14 series. This is what really matters for me.,2
I'm getting the Pro. Been using the 12 Pro Max since it came out and I think it's too big for one hand use.,1

Love those pocket operators. Never heard of them until this video and now I've done a ton of research on em lol. Would like to pick one up someday. Thanks for bringing this dope tech to our attention good sir!,2
That LED Message Board is super cool! So many options for use. Love watching your videos and seeing all of the cool affordable tech!,2
Love the Wormier keyboard! I have a full size keyboard and the compact option looks amazing and will be a better fit for my small desk.,2
I love how there's infinite possibilities that you can do with the pocket operator. Would love to pick up one of those for exploring it!,2
My favorite cool tech gadget in this episode was definitely the audio interface as I am starting to get into the streaming world. Great episode and for the amazing content.,2

"This was a fascinating look at something I love, by some genuinely interested people. I will add that you can build a significantly cheaper race bike, for a lower key series and still have fun on the track. I have a Minitwin which is relatively cheap to run, but a friend of mine has a litre plus missile and every time he crashes it, it costs about £5k and six months at least to fix! However, I far prefer long adventure rides to whizzing around the track, all of which you can do on a minitwin. 😁",2

Pretty happy with the oneplus 9. Camera is killer for sunny days on the beach. The oneplus carbon fiber case makes it feel excellent in the hand.,2

Lots of profit negative tech startup companies with an over abundant of overpaid employees…..honestly who hasn’t seen this coming?,0
It's just usual trimming of the fluff when excess liquidity is withdrawn. It's important to do it before you get to the down rounds.  That way VCs can decide which baby chicks to feed and which ones to shove out of the nest.,1
"What slowdown lol? It was abnormally fast and now with the recession, VCs realized many of these startups aren’t profitable so they laid off people. The big ones are still hiring and tech adoption isn’t nearly as much for it to slow down anytime soon.",0
I work in Cybersecurity. It hasn’t slowed down much because you can’t just stop securing your systems.,1
Slow hirings may be caused by a rapid rising labor cost in hi tech ind,0
"That's really a problem with service economy. Most tech companies don't even produce a nail. They do things that are intangible, you cay easily live without them. If Netflix goes down I am sure there will not be any catastrophic event. If some manufacturing companies goes down, let's say the one that makes baby formula, it could trigger a panic.",0
"Startups and bitcoin tech? Definitely. Hiring freeze at big tech companies? Maybe/Nah. You still get regular churnovers that free up positions (especially now where ppl switch jobs every 2 yrs).

"Interesting note: Real wasabi is difficult to cultivate and package and ship. It also grows only in a specific riverbank environment, which makes real wasabi expensive and in low supply. When young, real wasabi is a bit sweet not spicy. The ""wasabi"" that comes with your sushi dinner in America, it is most often just horseradish with green food coloring. This green-dyed horseradish replacing actual wasabi is known in the food world as an ersatz or a replica food.",1
"That “section of the tongue” theory is so funny to me because it’s what I was taught as a fact in my high school anatomy class and I was trying to test that out on my own and never could, I would always taste every flavor no matter where it was in my mouth.

Maybe it's because I know she's an audiologist but she annunciates everything beautifully and speaks with an even sound level. Like she clearly works with the hearing impared to naturally say every sound in a word to be heard as easily as possible,2

"Brilliant, well-spoken, well-enunciated, and a welcoming and animated face.  Great video!  I learned a lot.",2
"The way I was hyped to to this!! I was born with hearing loss, so I had to see MANY audiologist in my life so far. People like her made my life so much easier. Her talking about hearing aids and clearing up misconceptions or even spreading knowledge made me smile ear to ear.",2
About earplugs at concerts - there are a variety of frequency-balanced earplugs that protect your hearing while preserving the sound quality of the music (Eargasm and Hearos are a couple of examples). I HIGHLY recommend them!,2

Hey! By popular demand I made a list of all Cool Tech Under $50 products from the last 3 years archived so you can see it all on 1 page! https://lustre.ai/creator/randomfrankp,2
"My favorite product was definitely the wireless desk charger. Hope I can finally win one of these. Love your videos Frank, keep up the great work!",2
"On the wireless phone charger, I could see installing it under the wood in your nightstands if you have the right kind of furniture for the job. Also, the Echo Dot stand is super cute! Definitely made me think of Portal Turrets too!  Definitely my favorite!",2
"Loved the “invisible” charger, would definitely contribute to keeping my clean.",2
"Wow, that wireless desk charger is insanely cool. I would love one of those.",2
This channel is actually really cool. Instead of being just a kickstarter compilation these are all actual product reviews. Going to watch a few more before subscribing but so far extremely good channel,2
This might be the best episode of this series ever. So many great ideas!,2
The charger was my favorite. The hidden feature is cool but what I really like is the easy under the desk installation that also saves space,2
"What an awesome video, I love to see new affordable products come out!  This makes me wonder why certain tech devices have such an immense shelf price.  If more technology can be produced at cheaper costs, there may be some advancement in the asking price from many everyday-used devices such as laptops or desktops",2
I love wireless setups and the wireless charger is always a bonus! Thanks for the best content as always!,2
"Oh imagine when they get those sound wave extinguishers in giant sizes to catch the forest fires real quick. The people, animals and homes saved would be amazing. Not to mention the forests as well. What a brilliant invention. 😁👍☘️",2
That fire extinguisher could potentially be attached to drones to put out lightning strike fires and prevent future forest fires,1
"Imagine we could just buy a sized sheet of film like a screen protector then place it on any window or surface we like , such as a mirror , bench top or car windscreen , and then be able to utilise it like a touch screen 👍 would be more practical than buying an expensive mirror",2
"In my opinion, despite my fascination for the topic, an exoskeleton is a an autonomous Robot built around the human shape with the purpose of giving its ""pilot"" (haha) a sense of being superior while executing lowest work dependent on the mood of it's programmer/superuser, replacing the pilot when needed and sending all his collectable data to the company that is worried about our future with the best intentions.

"Floating cities sound pretty promising, as free land is already scarce. The question is who will rescue the cities from violent storms, or protect them from armed pirates. A floating city will need its own defenses, but will that be allowed within the 12 mile territorial limit?",1
"It’s awesome, but what happens to the humans that used to do these jobs?",2
"I want to know what problem that Quantum computer solved in a few minutes that would take a normal computer 10,000 years.",1
"AI is the most important one, a lot of people think AI is going to somehow mean self awareness, consciousness at some point.
The main implications of AI is that it is self improving, the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen
is that AI is going to overtake humans in a lot of things, including research and science. It is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change
everything about life far more than the industrial era did. For  example, 300 years from now we can have an AI program that has been improving itself for 300 years.
We lose about 1.4 million people each year from car accidents, and that is just fatalities, there are also many more injuries. So while I understand people being
skeptical about machines driving cars, as time goes on it is not even going to be close, AI is going to be able to do many, many things better than humans.
At some point, these quantum computers are going to make AI, they could program an AI to make a better AI of itself, an improved version.
Then the 2nd one can make a 3rd one that is better then it, etc. etc.
There is really no telling what this is going to do because we are not there yet but it is going to change things very rapidly when it happens.",1
The claim about the quantum computer came and went. I'm not sure who is on top. I'd like to see more of the Chinese tech. We seem to have very little insight into what they are doing.,1
"I can confirm her squirrel facts.  I raised an orphaned one, and it was the sweetest cuddliest pet until it almost grown.  Woke up one morning an she acted like a wild animal: biting, scratching, trying to eat my face off...  It was a sad day, but I've checked wanting a squirrel off my list!",0

I have a cat who was declawed by a previous owner. He has so many behavioral issues that are typical of declawed cats. He was just at the vet yesterday for litter box issues and the vet brought up the fact that he was declawed. Declawing inflicts lifelong trauma on the animal.,0

"I had a recent fall at work and because I trained myself how to fall off a bike safely, I only had minor bruising on my butt. I did a tuck and roll like when I fall off the bike. Great advise Alex and Ollie.",2
"When I got right hooked a few years ago, I only had time to think “this is gonna suck” and then proceeded to roll a ways on the pavement. Fortunately, I came away with ‘only’ bruises and road rash. Nothing got broken, and I think in part it was because I didn’t have a chance to put my hands out. Also, glad I was wearing a helmet!",2
"I still have my copy of Eddie Borysewicz's ""Bicycle Road Racing"" (1985). In it he discusses practicing tumbling and diving somersaults in a gym to improve your crash response. Unfortunately I haven't practiced that, but my last inelegant dismount was at low speed, so only some skin lost.",1
"#AskGCNTech after two years of running tubes, I finally went tubeless a couple of months ago. I managed to puncture my tyre the other day. Sealant didn’t do the trick nor did a couple of slugs - even tried a patch inside the tyre. The puncture was not on the sidewall and may have been 3mm large. Given the tire had plenty of life left, I am gutted that I may have to discard the tire now. When would you come to a decision that a tubeless tire is KO?",0
"#askgcntech Riding in a strong crosswind the other day, I wondered if a high cadence would give a gyroscope effect and reduce buffeting from the wind.  Presumably from feet and shoes if so. Can Ollie show us the maths please.",1
"My last crash (3 yrs ago).  I was on the ground so fast, I had no time to react or prepare for the impact.  But the scar from my collar bone repair looks pretty cool...",2
"Another problem with filling tires with water is that the first bump you hit will probably cause the tire to blow off the rim.  Water is incompressible, unlike air, so it has to go somewhere when the tire volume gets changed due to an impact.",0
"#AskGCNTech As a heavier rider, I feel I’m always in the max range of gears, either hardest gear on flat’sh roads or my easiest gear when I see any sustained gradients. I currently run a compact chain set with a 12-30 cassette on the rear. Would I benefit from upping my chain set to give me more usable gears or would this just make my climbing problem even worse due to the worse range at the rear",0
"I bought an old tractor to help clear the land I was building on. ""Stick with me."" 
I was towing a large log when I felt the back of my leg getting wet. No problem on the front of my trousers thank goodness. Turned out that a large sick had punctured one of the rear tires (tyres) 
Apparently it was fairly common practice to half fill the rear tyres (tires) with water to improve traction due to the added weight. Maybe sealant would be a better idea. Expensive though.
Love the show guys",2

"Having shot Canon for 20 years I switched the Nikon in 2016. Love both brands, but prefered the Nikon ergonomics with the dual command dials rather than the Canon methodology of the 4 buttons on the top plate. R5 really improved that but I love the ISOless nature of the Nikon sensors. Canon is getting better in that regard but still behind Nikon and Sony.",2
"Hey Marques! I know these sound insignificant, but since you rarely update your little dongles/accessories that you carry around and your apps on your home screens, I think it would be interesting to get a little maybe quarterly series where you talk about any changes and what you'd like to see changed/simplified with those work flows. Just an idea!",2
"@MKBHD I""m a photographer and use the Peak EDC V2.  I'm impressed you got a 16"" into the 20L  I'm sure it's a snug fit and doesn't leave alot of room for a ipad too.  Wanted to give you a little tip I found on that bag, here goes: The main compartment has a pass through to the top zip area where phones, airpods, etc go.  You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they're in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.  Not only that when they're done charging the battery starts charging.  I wake up with everything ready to go.  Hope you enjoy trying this out. :)",2
Would love to see an EDC/daily tech for everyone else in The Studio!,2
Marques's reaction was genuine here. He was excited to know as what will come out of his bag next 🤪,2
"I went to check out the Opal camera because I need a webcam upgrade and it looked pretty legit. I loved everything I saw on the site up until the point of the $4/month fee to use their software?! on a $300 webcam?! I think I'll just get a capture card for my mirrorless or pick up a Logi webcam instead :/

other than that, nice tech kit.

Also, yeah, your experience with the Pixel 6 mirrors my past experience with Pixel phones. I got one to try something different to the iPhone and I loved it for a few months. I tried a few customizations but found that leaving it stock was generally the best experience for me. Then it started unexpectedly slowing down or apps would wig out and crash on me out of nowhere or the camera just wouldn't or it would reboot in the middle of doing something.",2
"You are carrying great tech, and it makes total sense that you are rellying more and more on Apple, their ecosystem is really good. I am an Android user and don't stick to just one brand but my wife is All-Apple and she really likes how seemless everything is. Cool stuff Marques.",2
"Hey Marques, can you do an updated “The Ecosystem explained” I think a lot of viewers would appreciate a video not only for Apple side of the ecosystem but also Android, seeing as though a lot of new products are coming out in support for easy use for Androids. Love all your videos btw! 🖤",2
I can see that exoskeleton helping people with limited mobility in the future. It's a marvelous piece of tech. Thanks for giving us a glimpse of things to come!,2
"the exoskeleton probably wouldn’t be affordable for everyone to use, and may have long term effects, but i think it would be amazing for rehabilitation and other medical related use!",2
"I've got that Azeron keypad. HIGHLY recommend it for all kinds of applications where quickness is ideal, but especially for gaming. Highly highly. You can even find certain models on Amazon usually. I ordered mine from the factory, for the color scheme and one of the newer designs. (the one on this video is the original design, which I'm sure is still just as phenomenal, but my fingers twitch randomly sometimes, so having the buttons above the knuckle could have been a problem.",2
The game pad that you highlighted actually is already available. I am a right arm amputee and also a big gamer and was considering buying it but it’s over $200 US and you would still need a mouse. Also I have already become very proficient using a standard controller for gaming already and mostly mostly use an Xbox controller for my PC so I decided it wasn’t worth it. But it’s still a very good design in my opinion and I would love to see how it feels to use irl just not at that price point lol.,2
Cyborg game controller looks pretty neat. I am from from Latvia and that company makes pretty high end gaming gear (expensive too).,2

"Just a note on the screw driver. Put some ""extended"" bits with it or a smaller precision screw driver in the set with it.

I see this allot on Laptops, controllers that kinda thing. Sunk in screws suck.",0
"At this point I think that the whole point of labs was to fill it with more employees so that we never run out of Intel tech upgrades 

I will buy as many screwdrivers as it takes to pay their salaries plz just give me more Intel extreme tech upgrades",1
LTT Extreme Tech Upgrades will never not be absolutely funny and (somewhat) informative :),2
I think one of the things I love the most about these intel extreme upgrades is Linus learning and getting angry at his employees for everything about their lives.,2
This episode has me cracking up hard! Love the rabbit hole that Nick has gone down with the keyboard mods. Respect.,2

This is a common misconception. While part of the reason was the battery being too thin, the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch, which was a tiny dent in the top (left?) corner. This would cause the battery to eventually short out, as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other. Most people's phones were exploding while fast charging, which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery, and lithium-ion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that.

Edit: Normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine, and would never cause issues, but they made the battery too thin, meaning it shorted it out easier. Just wanted to clarify that.",0

"The states deregulated tuition and fees so the colleges could charge more. Then, they used that money to hire more administrators and build more buildings.

"Something important to know, for all who are interested in history and/or support Ukraine: 

Rus’ ought not to be confused with “Russia”, which derives its name from the Rus’ but historically is a completely different state, which almost all its existence was at war with the Rus’. 

Just like the Holy Roman Empire was actually Germany, Russia is actually Muscovy, despite their best attempts to convince everybody otherwise. 

Its name “Russia"" received only in 1721, when Peter I passed a decree to change Tsardom of Muscovy’s name into the “Russian” Empire (“Russia” originates from Rosia, name used by the Greek Orthodox Clergy in regards to Kyivan Rus')
Under the reign of Cathrine II Muscovites where even punished for continuing to identify as Muscovites, and were forced to call themselves “Russian”. 

Lands that “Russia” claims were part of the original Rus’, but actually weren't, are Novgorod, Suzdal, and Ryazan, since in historical texts of XI-XII centuries they are mentioned as separate entities from Rus’. They can be considered parts of extended Rus’, although their culture was distinct from main Rus’.

In 1493 Moscow prince Ivan III appointed himself to be the Great Ruler of All Rus’. No other kings acknowledged that. From that point on Muscovy started to make false claims on Rus’ ownership.

“Russia” is an offshoot of Ukraine and not the other way round, despite what Soviet and “Russian” historians have been trying to say for years. Kiev was a developed cultured capital when Moscow was just another swamp village.




Germany used to call itself the Holy Roman Empire, that didn’t mean they became the Romans, and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of Italy and its history, but yet, that’s exactly what “Russia” did in regards to Rus’-Ukraine, which is a horrible injustice!",1

"As a former combat planner in Vietnam, I agree with General Hodges. Putin's 'attrition' strategy is not well thought out. Firstly, they don't have the right equipment, manpower or time.

"A decisive battle between civilization and savagery has begun. Even in the Second World War it was not like that. Because the two savages were on different sides of the front. It was an inter-German showdown: the Germano-Slavic ethnic  of the Deutschs against the Germano-Celtic French and the English, and the Russian savagery was either together with the savagery of the Deutschs or against them. Now the front line has clearly been drawn between civilization and savagery. I see the philosophical law of contradiction: civilization is definitely a positive phenomenon, but it is mixed with negativity in the form of shame and cowardice: civilization has hid behind Ukraine and is waiting for something unknown. The memory of civilization's victory in this war will be tainted with the memory of shame.",1

2)Perdana menteri pertama ke penjara.....",1
Alhamdullilah....semoga najib tabah dan terima ini sebangai pengajaran yg amat berharga dlm hidupnya,1
"Peribahasa ‘orang tamak selalu rugi’ tu benar. Apa lagi yang tak cukup dengan Jawatan dan Gaji yang besar sebagai Perdana Menteri? Apa yang kurang dalam kehidupan seorang Perdana Menteri? Lebih menyedihkan, seorang muslim, beragama Islam, seorang pemimpin yg sepatutnya jadi teladan tapi berkelakuan sebaliknya. Semalam, beliau buat sumpah laknat, hari ni beliau ke penjara. Sedangkan semua bukti telah ditunjukkan di mahkamah bahawa ternyata beliau melakukan kesalahan, beliau masih berani bersumpah dengan nama Allah. Begitu mudah ucap dan permainkan nama Allah serta agamanya. Cukup ada seorang penyangak Najib di Malaysia ni, jangan kita benarkan dan lahirkan lebih ramai penyangak seperti Najib di masa akan datang. Jangan jadikan Malaysia kotor dan jijik di pndangan negara dunia lain.",1
"Peluang membela diri sejak minggu lalu disia-siakan dengan tindakan bersumpah laknat, berpakat malukan CJ Dan sandiwara.. Memang tiada niat nak Bela diri kerana terjerat habis dengan penipuan sendiri..!!",1
It’s really unfortunate that the intended target was missed.,0
My heartfelt condolences to the  car,1
"RIP to the Toyota Lancruiser also killed in the bombing.  It would have reach a retiring million Km mark with proper motor oil, transmission oil and gear cases maintenance. It will be missed by the local dealership & mechanic.",0
I feel so bad for the victim of that bombing. My heart goes out to the car.,0
"Sucks to suck, Dugin. Unfortunate a car was destroyed in the process.",0
Ukrainians express their deepest condolences to the vehicle she was in.,1
"Slava Ukraini !! I really hope that Mr. Dugin knows what the pain is when losing your shared ones.. like all the parents in Ukraine who lost daughters, sons, babies,Mom and Dad during that sad war !",0
"The ignorance of the people vilifying someone who tragically was assassinated is asinine. Also doesn't help, when you realize that Russia is using her death as a Franz Ferdinand moment. So yeah keep vilifying til your world ends, not a threat an analyzation.

With this, Russia won't stop til Ukraine falls.",0
"I’m dead serious about this, he switched cars at the last second, now why would he do that? Felt his safety was in danger? Something doesn’t  add up about all this.",0
"I feel bad for the daughter, not for the father",0
The case was brought to Federal Court only to have another year of freedom. His side clearly had no proper counter arguments from the start. Pity the court of having to deal with this drama.,0
"My salute to the judges. They are not swayed by threats, accusations against them. Justice is served.",2
This is the real meaning of MERDEKA...for RAKYAT.🙏,2
Imagine a Prime Minister this corrupted. Can you think of the people in his circle?,0
Fair and transparent trial and appeal despite vile attempts to delay and frustrate justice,0
"The best day of my life, the best news ever. Whatever goes around comes around. Justice prevailed, thank God",2
There is hope for our nation! Thank you to the prosecution and judiacry.,2
This year Merdeka is probably one of the most memorable ones after Najib's final verdict. The judges are our last straw of hope to bring corruptors behind the bars,2
"The court had done its job. Now the rakyat's turn. If BN wins the next PRU, it'll likely be that they ask for royal pardon to free him. It'll be difficult to know if Agong will grant it seeing this is a serious crime of trustworthiness and integrity. We do not know. It's our job to make sure BN has no such opportunity.",0
Finally justice has been served to Najib Razak!,1
Thank God for the people who called it in and the officers who responded.,2
Whoever saw him and said something saved untold innocent lives.,1
"Great job to everyone that was aware and made a call to action. You helped save lives. Unfortunately this is becoming the normal but if we are alert and step in, we can avoid a tragedy.",2
Shows what a tremendous difference we can make by being alert and notifying the authorities when suspicious. Better to be safe than sorry. The police aren’t able to do this on their own without us all being aware and responsible citizens. Massive thank you to all those involved especially those who did chose to speak up! 🙏🏻🕊,2
I’m grateful that someone was paying attention and called it in and everyone is safe. I’m sad for the young lady though who feels like it was the only place she could go to feel accepted. I hope she can find some peace and friendship in a more permanent way.,2
Bless the witnesses who reported this and the police who responded. We should all take note and keep our eyes out to protect each other.,1
My friends were there last night. FUCKING PROPS to those that called it in!,0
Excellent job to the Grant county sheriff's office and to the people attending the concert who kept an eye out and reported it.,2
Thank God that someone was observant and took action to prevent another mass shooting.,1
This is terrifying. A couple days ago I was just talking to my friend who went to a music festival where the security didn't even check bags. She was kinda scared how an event like that could easily be the target of mass shooting.,0

I am romanian but have many polish friends and I am also ex Romanian military.

Soooo..I don t think Poland would stand alone.

"Netflix is getting into video games for the same reason Apple is launching a car and Amazon is getting into healthcare. These high high tech company have to constantly keep growing in order to justify their insane valuations, and in many cases their core businesses wont offer enough revenue to satisfy investors growth expectations",1
Netflix in a lot of trouble now especially as more market competition comes in from other distributors. This move into gaming will not do them any favours.,0
"The reason Netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content, their own content, when it's good, is constantly neglected, and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it. Getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what they're doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults. People are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update. People are used to getting the next season of a series once every year, but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release, even before COVID.",0
"When I first got into watching Netflix, there were a lot of low budget but very original and interesting documentaries and TV series on it. However in recent times, I feel like a lot of the diversity in the platform has gone.",2
"This is the problem with these big companies, their core offering starts to fail and they think moving focus elsewhere is the answer instead of making sure their core offering is decent.",0
I worked in retail for most of my life and the one thing I have never forgotten is the fact that once you lose a customer you are going to play hell trying to get them back regardless of what you do.,0
"I think it’s so silly that Netflix feels the need to compete with YouTube and TikTok. I think these platforms should be able to exist together in harmony as they each offer very different products. Eg. People can follow along with reactions/reviews and video essays while watching a Netflix series.

People also don’t typically like when YouTubers are given a large budget like with YouTube Red originals, so Netflix buying out certain YouTubers is not the right idea…",0
"Honestly maybe it would have made more sense to commission more games based on their original IPs. Yeah it takes longer to come out, but you’ll get better quality and hopefully better return on investment",2
"I think this is gonna take Netflix back to its feets, it just needs more perseverance. And the ability to be positive minded",2

Bonjour m4f merci pour tes videos :) je t'ecrit pour te demander quelque chose ^^ j'aimerais savoir si c'est normal qu'en jouant morati sur IE qund je prend une porte d'ultuan aucune garnison n'apparait et aussi si c'est normal que en jouant boris ursus possedant totalement la province ou on debute et n'ayant plus du tout de corruption je recrute un nouveau seigneur il prend de l'usure ?? merci et bonne journée,1
mes vasseaux se font déchirer à chaque fois que j'essai de m'etendre d'un coté avec valkia c'est affolant :o,1
C'est quand même dommage... qu'il n'y ai pas des aspirants champions de Khorne.,1

Hey I have being a fan since you guys started I followed you guys since I was young.keep up the great work 😊,2
2:16 that face tho😂,1
Great job guys! Love watching you guys with my 5 year old son.  Wish I had seen this video a couple days ago before we spent so much time confused by all the Dragon Ball Z stuff too 😂,2
"Dragon Ball: Goku is a kid with a monkey tail where he lives in a small house with a dragon ball. He meets Bulma and they go searching for Dragon balls to summon a dragon name shenron. He grants you one wish. He trains with a kid name Krillin which they become best friends. Krillin get killed by a demon king, the demon king gets killed by Goku with a kamehameha. He spits out an egg with his son in it name Piccolo. Goku is a teenager. He meets Chi Chi in the Martial Arts Tournament and all his friends. He fight Piccolo and wins the Tournament. Goku and Chi Chi have a son and Gohan. That’s the end of Dragon Ball. Now for Dragon Ball Z",1
You Guys make my day every time you play together as a family like this keep it up 👍,2
You’ll do awesome videos I always love watching them,2

Schöner Einstieg in die Spacecom 2022!,1
"Ich privat finde dieses Gewese um die Spiele auch manchmal hart ermüdend: Da wird kein Spiel vorgestellt, sondern das Team das dann 5 Minuten mit Buzzwörtern um sich wirft ""New Expierence"" ""New Lifestyle"" und ""Exciting World"" und man sieht dann gefühlt 20 Sekunden den Teaser zum Spiel. 
Wenn die nix zu zeigen haben sollten sie es einfach lassen, kann alle auf dem Sofa verstehen",1
Für mich sind einige Spiele interessant. Nur fehlendes Gameplay nervt. War also in Ordnung.,1

I'm surprised getting all the collectibles didn't even get an honorable mention. There's been more than enough people who couldn't 100% the Arkham games simply because they didn't like the Riddler trophy collecting quest (especially Arkham Knight due to how many times you had to use the batmobile JUST for those collectibles).,0
The one that annoyed me was the Borderlands 1 when to obtain you had to play online with someone from Gearbox or with someone who already had the trophy. They changed it for the rerelease to playing with three players at once.,0
"I always adored FFVIII. My older brother gifted me with the strategy guide when I first bought it, so that may have something to do with it lol. That said, if you're trying to 100% FFVIII on the og north american release, good luck. A strategy guide will not help you get the ribbon",2
"The original infamous hurt my soul. I played through the campaign twice on hard to get the platinum only to find out while I was doing cleanup that the stunt master trophy can't be completed post game. I had all but one stunt, to knock 3 enemies off a roof at once. When you clear out an area enemies no longer spawn in large numbers, therefore there isn't enough enemies to get the stunt. I didn't have it in me to start another campaign. The sad part is I had tried the stunt on multiple occasions only for it to glitch and not award the stunt.",0
"AC3 was super annoying when first released because of having to pass the mission the first time without any retry. 

Problem was, the controls were clunky af and the goals of the missions most of the time were annoying or without too much logic like ""do not touch water"".",0
"Multiplayer trophies tied to the platinum will always, ALWAYS be the worst.",0
Multi-player and single player trophies/achievements 100% should be separate as their own 100% completion lists,1
"So glad you did multiplayer awards lumped with single player awards. That is the biggest bullshit for single game players that don't want to listen to children screaming, neck beards eating or just racist hateful crap, just for a trophy.",0
I honestly feel like COD MW on did it best on Xbox 360. Achievements for single player and challenges for multiplayer. That was 2007. Now I’m 34 with a wife and kids. It’s almost unimaginable trying to do 100% a game with multiplayer supporting a family and working.,2
You guys are really getting your money's worth with the new background music.,2

"The only unrealistic part is having consistent connection with very little delay because even in this decade, big pings and lags is still a common occurences.",0
"As someone living in the future, I can confirm that this is perfectly accurate.",2
"i remember doing this back in 2000, good times. (Talking about his mother)",2
"The ""very little time delay"" is the reason why It's still considered something in the future",1
This honestly sounded like a legitimate prediction until the last part. XD,2
"Wow, the concept of sending games over the internet lines sounds so compelling.
I wish online multiplayer was real 😞",2
"Impossible, nothing like that could ever be made.",0
"Man I love seeing old media predict the future correctly, they even showed the lack of joy all gamers have.",2

As a destiny veteran and current destiny 2 tourneys player I think they did pretty good with Zavala and the others Ikora and exo stranger,2
"Massive thank you to everyone for checking out the video. I went back and forward on making it - whether it was ""too negative"" or not - but VERY reassuring to know it's not just me noticing these things, and wanting to talk about them. Cheers! - Scott",2
"I adopted a mindset of delaying my gaming brain by a year. If a game comes out in 2022, I wait until 2023. I get it at its cheapest and usually complete. I have been doing this with every game I buy for the last 5 years and I have saved so much money while enjoying the games much more.",2
"I used to pre-order games to get the “collectible” toy that was sought after. The items got really cheap really fast. Not worth it. They also tell you that there may not be enough copies, that never happened! There was always enough copies!",0
"Good video. These are the kinds of topics and discussions the gaming industry needs to need to be having now. Publishers, developers, the media, and gamers themselves. 

Have to throw one in though. For every game with a yearly release, I also have to point out games with decade or more release cycle. How long between GTA 5 and 6? Fallout 4 and 5? Skyrim and Elder Scrolls 6?",2
"I wish developers would realize that forced DRM and Internet connectivity for games is a step backward. Look at the debacles GT7 and SimCity have endured; what's the point of paying a full $70 for the game if there is no guarantee you can play it at your leisure, especially if this ridiculous requirement is in place for SINGLE-PLAYER modes?

In my opinion, at that point, you can't help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job. This is not why people play games.",0
"When I think about the games I played the last few years, I must say, that I almost always enjoyed indie titles alot more than big IPs. So I rather pay 30€ for an indie title, that is really inspiring with fresh new ideas than wasting 60€+ on a broken AAA title without any innovations.",2
"Great vid, points are spot on, only 4 or 5 years ago, feels like I bought every major release at midnight, and after Cyberpunk, Fallout, No Mans Sky, I’m never buying a day one game again.  My gaming and spending habits have completely changed.  The gaming biz can’t devolve and expect players to keep up the old pace.",1
"I havent bought a game on release for the past 6 years now. The gaming industry has changed for a while now, and its only getting worse. I buy 3~4 games per year at most and usually heavily discounted. Quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays, CoD and Battlefield lost their way. Quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy GoTY editions usually and often second hand (gotta love disc edition systems). I refuse to fuel bad descions made by money hungry devs or publishers.",0
"I tend to stick to games made before 2010 as they give the best value and experience.
Feels like games were made for fun rather then rip off the player.",2
"This video made me a bit sad. Made me realise how the industry has changed, and not for the better. I have young children so can’t game like I used to but when I do have time I find myself increasingly drawn back to older games that I’ve played before but adore, the vast majority of new games just don’t appeal to me. As for the new gen consoles…what’s the point, all they seem to be doing is rereleasing older gen games. Yawn",0
"ONE OF THE BEST THING ABOUT DUDE IS THAT HE NEVER TAKES CREDIT FOR HIMSELF WHEN HE ACHIEVED SOMETHING. HE ALWAYS REGULAR US. THE AUDIENCE HIS TEAM, AND HE IS POLITE IN ALL HIS VIDEO. WE CONGRATULATIET OURSELVES ON THIS ACHIEVEMENT. MORE TO COME",2
